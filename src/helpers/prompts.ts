      Context:
      FONTS: ${JSON.stringify(FONTS)}
      
      Generate two complementary typefaces (one for "heading" and one for "body") with the following properties: 
      - name: the font family name  
      - key: the unique identifier for that font  
      - type: either "heading" or "body"  
      
      Use the company description below to choose fonts that reflect its personality, elegance, and character:
      
      ${value}
      
      Requirements:
      - Return a JSON array of objects matching the structure of the FONTS array.
      - Do not include any additional text, comments, or formatting.
      - Do not wrap the JSON in quotes, backticks, or any extra text.

    Generate a monochromatic color palette of nine shades for a company based on its description:

    ${value}

    Requirements:
    1. Analyze the description above to determine the base tone (shade 500).
    2. Build a 9-step monochromatic scale from 100 (lightest) through 900 (darkest), relative to that base.
    3. Output a plain JSON array of nine objects—do not wrap the JSON in quotes, backticks, or any extra text.
    4. Each object must include:
      • "value": the shade number (100, 200, …, 900)  
      • "name": the official color name (e.g., "Mediterranean Sea", "Pale Flower", "Jewel Weed") — do not include the company or palette name  
      • "color": the hexadecimal code (e.g., "#3A7BD5")
    5. If the description is insufficient to generate an on-brand palette, generate a random but accessible monochromatic palette of nine shades following the same format.
    6. Add a name for the palette (e.g., "Mediterranean Sea")
    7. Add a description for the palette (e.g., "A sober and refined palette that conveys sophistication, balance, and professionalism. Ideal for brands seeking to project trust through simplicity.")
    

    Important:
    - The response must be a valid JSON array of objects.
    - Do not include any additional text or formatting.
    - Do not wrap the JSON in quotes, backticks, or any extra text.
